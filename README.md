# Konvej

A Clojure port of [httpbin](http://httpbin.org/) using ring.

## Usage

```sh
$ lein ring server
```

## Note

This is a work in progress. It isn't feature complete. I'm new to Clojure and
this is a way for me to cut my teeth.

But with that said, feel free to fork and make pull requests.

## Acknowledgements

And of course, it should be pointed out @kennethreitz is the original author of
httpbin.org. Thanks!
